Purpose of the Application:

What is the PetApplication? The PetApplication is an interactive and family friendly application that allows users to interact with a virtual pet (Tamagotchi). Allowing the users to have the pleasures of raising and taking care of a pet without the stress of dealing with a living, breathing pet or the responsibilities that comes with it. Users can clean, feed and play with their virtual pets and are only limited by the pets complete satisfaction. 
The app allows users to choose between 2 pets, a cat and a dog. This is a special feature that creates a more interesting dynamic between the users and the pets. Users are able to enjoy some more creative liberties and are likely to engage with the app more than similar applications. 

Design of the Application:

The design of PetApplication is simple. It utilizes an interactive user interface, with varying colours that were carefully selected via hex colour pallets. The soft colours allow for an ergonomic experience, increasing users’ interaction with the application. Due to the app’s duality, use of multiple (4) MainActivities, the design had to be coordinated and match seamlessly with the rest of the pages available to users. 
The Home Page of the application clearly displays lax and soft fonts, that are eye catching yet not overbearing. The use of a dogs on the cover cements to the users who are unable to read (young children) that the application involves domestic animals (dogs).

The design of the Cat home page (MainActivity2) and Dog home page(MainActivity4) are colourful and pleasant to the users, allowing them to enjoy a cute and friendly app. They can feed, clean, and play with their chosen pet. Buttons chosen for these pages are clean and match the aesthetic appeal of the application elegantly.
